## Learnings

- The core implementation target is a Rust CLI plus MCP server.
- The system is intentionally local-first and zero-network for embeddings.
- Every meaningful implementation starts with an OpenSpec proposal.
- Always run `cargo fmt --all` before committing Rust code — CI enforces `cargo fmt --check` as the first gate and will skip all subsequent steps (clippy, check, test) if formatting fails.
- Local Windows dev environment lacks MSVC SDK libs (`msvcrt.lib`), so clippy/build/test cannot run locally. Use CI (Linux) for full validation. Only `cargo fmt` works locally.
- CI runs `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` which treats all warnings as errors. Stub functions with `todo!()` bodies must prefix all params with `_` to avoid unused variable errors.
- `version.rs` was removed — it was dead code never referenced from `mod.rs` or `main.rs`.
- PR #9 review (2026-04-14): Copilot automated reviewer caught 9 issues. 7 applied in Sprint 0 scope (CLI contract alignment, schema CHECK, docs fixes, Cargo.lock, hygiene). CI clippy `-D warnings` left as-is since stubs already fixed. Repo hygiene pass removed `gh_diagnostic.py`, one-time session artifacts.
- CLI contract must match `docs/spec.md` exactly — the spec defines the scaffold's surface. `default_db_path()` must resolve to `./brain.db`, not `$HOME/brain.db`.
- `init` and `version` commands don't require a database connection; dispatch them before `db::open()` in main.
